**Flutter Trading App**

**Introduction**
Welcome to the Flutter Trading App! This application enables users to engage in real-time trading data exploration through an interactive graph.

**Getting Started**
To run the app from the command line, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=firebase_options.json
```

**User Authentication**
The app features a secure authentication system allowing users to seamlessly login or register. Follow the on-screen instructions to create an account or log in with existing credentials.

**Trading Screen**
Upon the initial load of the trading screen, please be patient as the app retrieves data from a public API. The initial loading may take some time due to the API's limitations.

**Note on Graph Rendering**
The graph on the trading screen may initially appear empty as it requires at least two values to draw a line. The public WebSocket API used in this app may introduce a delay in providing new values. Therefore, it might take a few seconds for the graph to display meaningful data after the initial loading is complete.
